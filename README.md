# PeerLend

## Purpose:
    * As of now, the purpose of this project is to create a Peer-to-Peer lending application. This application will utilize crypto as it's means of exchange. There will be borrowers and lenders, which both parties can come to terms on a contract by negotiating terms and details. Collateral can be used to hold borrowers responsible for paying back their loaned amount from their lender. As of now, the plan is only to allow ETH to be lended and for ETH to be staked as collateral.

## To-Do:
    * Create ability to pair a borrower's request to a lenders response
        * This is because if a lender accepts a borrower's request, the index of the borrower needs to match with say lender
        * Thus having the same contract/negotiating index
    * Be able to show all borrower requests instead of indexing through an array
    * 
    * Optimize gas for functions
